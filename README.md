# Secure Password Generator

## Description

A secure password generator created as part of a homework assignment. The generator will randomly generate a password when the user clicks the "Generate Password" button. The user will be prompted to how long they would like their password to be, and whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

If a user enters a password length shorter than 8 or longer than 128 or do not select any character types they will receive a warning and need to restart.

The password is displayed on the page for the viewer to copy.

**Password options:**

- Password length between 8 and 128 characters
- Lowercase characters
- Uppercase characters
- Numeric characters
- Special characters
